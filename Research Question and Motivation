Our project aims to use machine learning to investigate possible biases in the music industry, specifically in the selection process for
Grammy-winning albums. We seek to predict whether an album will receive a Grammy award and uncover any patterns or trends that may
exist in the decision-making process. Rather than relying on genre labels to train our model, we analyze an album's pure statistics,
such as its danceability and energy, to draw conclusions about the underlying factors that influence the selection process. We question
whether critically acclaimed music is inherently biased and hope that our project will contribute to a more transparent and fair music industry.
