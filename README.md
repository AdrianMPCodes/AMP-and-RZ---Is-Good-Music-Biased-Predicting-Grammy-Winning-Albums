# AMP-and-RZ---Is-Good-Music-Biased-Predicting-Grammy-Winning-Albums

Our project, "Is 'Good' Music Biased: Predicting Winning Albums," aims to explore potential biases within the music industry and the Grammy Awards. We have scraped data from various sources, including Spotify and Wikipedia, to create a dataset of Grammy-nominated and winning albums. Using machine learning techniques, we have developed a model to predict future Grammy winners and identify past winners, testing different models like linear regression and k nearest neighbors. To obtain our final model, we employed different techniques, including recursive backtracking, to select the best features that produce the highest F1 score. Moreover, we also tested different models, such as linear regression and k nearest neighbors, to ensure that the model is effective in making accurate predictions. Our analysis of the dataset has also enabled us to identify patterns and trends that may indicate any biases in the industry. We have presented our findings using various visualizations, such as graphs and charts. Ultimately, our project seeks to provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to an artist's success in the music industry.
